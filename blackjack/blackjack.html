        <p>Rules:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>This game is single deck. The deck is shuffled before the start of every new game.</li>
          <li>Each game has 5 players (4 computer players) and a dealer.</li>
          <li>Cards are dealt in a clockwise order.</li>
          <li>All player cards are face up. The dealer has the first card face up.</li>
          <li>After cards have been dealt, the game checks if any players or the dealer has blackjack</li>
          <li>After blackjack check, player round commences. This goes clockwise.</li>
          <li>Your turn has two options: hit adds a card, stand finalises hand for the round</li>
          <li>After the final player's turn, the dealer will reveal the second card.</li>
          <li>The dealer draws until they have a score of 17 or higher.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <p>
          This does not deal with special scenarios such as double down, splitting, surrender or insurance. Insurance is
          avaliable when the dealer's face up card is an ace. Double down is only avaliable on the first turn, the
          player gets one more card and ends their turn. Splitting is when you start with a pair. You can split up to
          three times.
        </p>
        <p>
          The computer controlled players behave predictably. If the sum of their cards are below a certain threshold,
          they will hit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another random function to deal cards would be better, at the moment its possible to see the next card using
          the browser console.
        </p>
        <p>The dealer's second card should be revealed in a second stamp.</p>
        <p>There is an issue where if someone is dealt two aces it gives an error.</p>
