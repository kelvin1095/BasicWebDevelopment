        <p>Rules:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>This game is single deck. The deck is shuffled before the start of every new game.</li>
          <li>Each game has 5 players (4 computer players) and a dealer.</li>
          <li>Cards are dealt in a clockwise order.</li>
          <li>All player cards are face up. The dealer has the first card face up.</li>
          <li>After cards have been dealt, the game checks if any players or the dealer has blackjack</li>
          <li>After blackjack check, player round commences. This goes clockwise.</li>
          <li>Your turn has two options: hit adds a card, stand finalises hand for the round</li>
          <li>After the final player's turn, the dealer will reveal the second card.</li>
          <li>The dealer draws until they have a score of 17 or higher.</li>
        </ul>

          card is an ace. Double down i

        <p>
          The computer controlled players behave predictably. If the sum of their cards are below a certain threshold,
          they will hit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Random function to deal cards would be better, at the moment its possible to see the next card. In addition,
          Ace cards counting as 1 is not yet programmed in.
