# Learning front end web development.

This repo contains all files I have written to aid in learning front end web development.

## What I have learnt so far:

- HTML: This is like the skeleton of a webpage. Instead of bones, it is made up of a lot of boxes.
- CSS: CSS is used to tell the box what colour, font, location everything should be.
- JavaScript: JS is the programming language behind everything. It allows the webpage to be dynamic. Have some action take place in one part of the webpage, then javascript is used to convert that action into something new that possible shows up on a different part of the webpage.
- Git: Version control all the files in the project.

## JavaScript Packages

- React: React is a way of writing JS code.
- Babel: Makes writing JS code for React much simplier by allowing writing html code directly in the .js file.
- Webpack: This allows modules to be bundled up so that in theory there are less things that get downloaded when a webpage is downloaded.
